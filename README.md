# MCP Client Configuration with Azure App Configuration

## Bridging the Development-Production Gap

Developers predominantly work with MCP servers locally today using tools like Claude Desktop or VSCode. While these environments are excellent for experimentation and development, transitioning MCP-powered applications to production environments presents significant challenges:

- **Configuration Management**: Local configurations (like VSCode's mcp.json) don't translate seamlessly to production environments
- **Scalability Concerns**: Production deployments introduce configuration sprawl when MCP settings must be duplicated across every service instance, creating maintenance overhead and inconsistency risks
- **Security Requirements**: Moving beyond local development necessitates proper authentication and authorization
- **Operational Flexibility**: The ability to update configurations without redeployment becomes critical

## The ConfiguredMcpClient Solution

The ConfiguredMcpClient implementation addresses these challenges by:

- **Centralizing Configuration**: Storing all MCP server configurations in Azure App Configuration
- **Enabling Dynamic Update**s: Allowing changes to MCP servers without application redeployment
- **Supporting Environment-Specific Setups**: Maintaining separate configurations for development, testing, and production
- **Facilitating Deployment Strategies**: Enabling blue-green deployments, canary releases, and A/B testing of different model configurations

Key Capabilities

- **Configuration Abstraction**: Write your application once and connect to different MCP servers based on environment
- **Auto-Refresh Mechanism** Configurations update automatically at configurable intervals
- **Seamless Authentication**: Integration with Microsoft Entra ID for secure access to Azure resources
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Support for various MCP server types (stdio, sse, etc.) with environment-specific parameters

## Setup Azure App Configuration

1. Create an Azure App Configuration store in the Azure Portal
2. Add your MCP server configurations as key-value pairs:

Example: Azure MCP Server (stdio type)

Key: MCP:AzureMCPServer

Value:

```json
{
    "name": "Azure MCP Server",
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
        "-y",
        "@azure/mcp@latest",
        "server",
        "start"
    ]
}
```

Example: Remote SSE Server

Key: MCP:Fetch

Value:
```json
{
    "name": "Fetch",
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch"
}
```

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Environment-Specific Configurations**:
   - Use labels in Azure App Configuration to separate dev/test/prod environments
   - Example: `MCP:AzureMCPServer;env=production` vs `MCP:AzureMCPServer;env=development`

2. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Add telemetry to track model performance in production
   - Use configuration to enable/disable detailed logging

3. **Rollback Strategy**:
   - Maintain previous working configurations with version labels
   - Implement quick rollback procedures for production issues

4. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Validate new configurations before applying them to production
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
